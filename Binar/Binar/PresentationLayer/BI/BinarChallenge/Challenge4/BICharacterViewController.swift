Michael De Santa, formerly Michael Townley, is one of the three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, along with Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips. He is voiced by Ned Luke. \n\nMichael is a former bank robber and career criminal, who faked his death to retire and live a peaceful life with his family in Los Santos. However, he suffers from his unhealthy relationship with them, and soon gets pulled back into his criminal life, forcing him to return to his old ways. Michael's story centers around how his seemingly idyllic and halcyon lifestyle is brought to a halt as his past demons and morally compromising mistakes come back to haunt him. \n\nMeanwhile, his midlife crisis pushes him to his ultimate snapping point, and he becomes determined to achieve something more with his life, while also attempting to escape his past, become a free man and start a new life with his family. Michael is an old friend of fellow protagonist Trevor, and, early on in the storyline, he also befriends Franklin and becomes a mentor figure to him. He is the husband of Amanda, and the father of Jimmy and Tracey.

Due to his limited mobility, Lester has grown considerably overweight, and he also suffers from asthma. It is implied that Lester was bullied in high school, as he posted on Bleeter that "getting revenge" on his old high school class "never seemed to get old". \n\nSome time after he finished his studies, Lester applied for a faculty position at the University of San Andreas, Los Santos, but was not accepted. As an act of revenge, he hacked their systems. \n\nAt an unknown point in time, Lester met and became affiliated with bank robbers Michael Townley and Trevor Philips, becoming a regular member of their heist crews since the start of their partnership, working mostly as a planner and information scout. In 2004, Lester refused to participate in robbing a cash storage facility in Ludendorff, North Yankton, believing it was a bad idea. His suspicions are later confirmed when he discovers that, during this same heist, Michael faked his death and moved to Los Santos, having previously made a deal with Federal Investigation Bureau agent Dave Norton, but as Michael never mentioned him as part of the crew, he kept quiet about Michael's secret. After this, Michael, Trevor, and Lester lost contact with each other, though Lester secretly kept tabs on Michael and Trevor's whereabouts. \n\nAt some point, Lester moved to Los Santos as well, and purchased a garment factory in La Mesa, along with several other properties to use as fronts for his various operations.

At another unknown point in time, Dave married an unnamed woman, though they have since divorced. According to Lester Crest, Dave's career with the FIB had been "unremarkable" until 2004, when he discovered the whereabouts of bank robber Michael Townley in Ludendorff, North Yankton. Dave made a deal with Michael to surrender his accomplice Trevor Philips to the FIB, whilst Michael would fake his death after being "shot" by Dave, in turn boosting Dave's career for taking down the "most wanted man in America".
